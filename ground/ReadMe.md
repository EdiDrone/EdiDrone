# Ground Control Station

Software that goes on the ground-based controller goes here.

A controller app written in Cocos2d-x v3.4 C++ to pilot the EdiDrone.
The android version has already been pre-compiled and the apk is in the bin folder, if you want to run it.

In order to modify the files, you would need to setup your environment first.
You can download the latest framework here:
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download
In the framework, there's a README file that teaches you how to setup the environment dependencies.
But it is basically running the setup.py in the terminal and following through with the instructions.

Then you are able to modify the files freely.
Here's more information about how to build a Cocos2d-x Android Project.

But it is basically just running the build_native.py in the terminal to compile the changes made.
