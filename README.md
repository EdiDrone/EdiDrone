# EdiDrone

This is the git repo for the Intel Edison Hackathon.

Please observe Gitflow workflow.

1. Create branch for new features
2. Work in new feature branch
3. Submit pull request back into master
4. Review is important. We'll try to streamline it as much as possible, but because we're working with a flying robot code integrity is important. Doubly so as we get fatigued through the night. The basic rule is that a developer should never merge his own work, i.e. if you submit the pull request don't click the merge button, let someone else do that for you.
